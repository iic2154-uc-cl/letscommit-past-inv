## Description

In software engineering, effective commit messages are crucial for maintaining a clear project history, facilitating collaboration, and improving codebase management. However, students in capstone projects often struggle with crafting meaningful commit messages. To address this, we propose leveraging Generative AI to enhance the quality of commit messages. This approach involves analyzing code changes and offering three possible commit message options, along with the flexibility for students to create their own messages based on the suggestions.

### Problem

Students often struggle with writing clear and concise commit messages, which can lead to poorly documented project histories.

### Solution

`letscommit` uses Generative AI to analyze code changes and provide three commit message suggestions. For example, if a student makes changes to improve the performance of a function, the tool might suggest:

1. "Optimize function for better performance."
2. "Refactor code to enhance efficiency."
3. "Improve function execution time."

Students can choose one of these suggestions or use them as a basis to craft their own commit message.
